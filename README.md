# USScode
Code for USS Psychophysical/A.I project:

The USS project is focused on investigating the relationship between breathing and perceptual judgment in a visual task. The goal is to understand how our perception and response to visual stimuli are influenced by our breathing patterns.

To run the code associated with the project, we use a CSV file named "circledata.csv" containing the relevant data, including information on foil numbers, JND values, and response colors. We then adjust the code to analyze the data and generate visualizations.

The code utilizes the Python programming language and built in libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. It loads the data from the CSV file, extracts the necessary columns, and creates scatter plots to visualize the relationship between foil numbers, JND values, and response colors. The code also includes a prediction section using a linear regression model to predict future JND values based on the provided data.

By running this code, researchers can gain insights into how breathing influences perception and response. The generated visualizations can help visualize the patterns and relationships in the data. Additionally, the prediction feature allows for the prediction of future JND values based on the provided dataset. This project provides a valuable tool for exploring the impact of breathing on perceptual judgments and can contribute to our understanding of human sensory processing.
